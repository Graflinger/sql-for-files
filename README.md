## 🚀 Overview

**SQL for Files** is a privacy-first, browser-based SQL query interface that allows you to analyze your data files without uploading them anywhere. All processing happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly technology.

Perfect for data analysts, developers, and anyone who needs to quickly query data files without installing database software or uploading sensitive data to cloud services.
